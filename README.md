# dfa

dfa is a simulation for deterministic finite automata created for an automata and languages class. The application has 2 modes of operation:

If given a .dfa filename and a string, it will determine if the DFA accepts the string.
If given 2 .dfa filenames, it will determine if the DFAs are equivalent.
